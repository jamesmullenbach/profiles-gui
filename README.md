profiles-gui
============
I built this GUI in the fall of 2013 using MATLAB's built in GUI builder. Its functionality was to take in a series of images, on which the user could then draw a line in any direction. The program could then extract the profile of that line - that is, the intensity of the pixels along it, and if the timelapse option was checked, would do so for every other image in the series. The program would then output the raw data of the profiles of the lines, as well as produce appropriate plots for each line drawn.
